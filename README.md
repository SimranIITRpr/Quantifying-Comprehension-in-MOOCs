# Quantifying-Comprehension-in-MOOCs

Due to no face to face interaction on MOOCs, it becomes often difficult to judge the comprehension of course contents perceived by the students. In this study, we propose to use a portal called QWiki. It is a combination of QnA forum and wiki portal. The data collected from QWiki along with video transcripts helps to figure out the discrepancies between comprehension perceived by students and explanation given in videos.
